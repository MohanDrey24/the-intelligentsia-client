# Components Directory Structure

- `ui/` — Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, etc.)
- `layout/` — Layout-related components (headers, footers, wrappers)
- Other feature-specific folders can be added as needed.

Place shared and atomic components in `ui/`, and structural or page-level components in `layout/`.
